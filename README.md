# Probabilistic-Machine-Learning_lecture-PROJECTS

## Welcome to the repository for the end of semester SoSe2025 projects for the Probabilistic Machine Learning Lecture by Dr. Alvaro Diaz-Ruelas.

## IMPORTANT: **How to make your project-ID if you do not have one already?**
Ideally, first send me a project proposal in an email (preferably containing and/or describing the dataset(s)). If I approve the project, I will create the ID for you.
Otherwise:

    1. The first 2 digits of the ID correspond to the day of the month when the project is chosen
    2. Then a hypen: -
    3. Then the order of arrival
    4. Then the initials (starting by surname, then first name) for each member of the group, up to 3 members, and XX for each empty member.

For instance, if I, Alvaro Diaz-Ruelas chooses his project on the 12th of Mai, and I notice that there are already 6 other projects chosen on that day before me, my ID is: 

    12-7DAXXXX.

If, instead of being alone I make the project with a colleague, say, Geoffrey Hinton, then the ID of our project is: 

    12-7DAHGXX.

**How to name the folder of my project?** We append to the project-ID a short string without spaces as descriptive as possible: 12-7DAHGXX_double_descent
Now we can proceed to create a folder under the projects/ folder.
